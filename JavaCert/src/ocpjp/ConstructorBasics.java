	 * Above three modifier final, abstarct and static are not valid for constructor as
	  
	 When you set a method as final, it means : "You don't want any class override it", but constructor by JLS definition can't overridden,so it is clean.
	 
	 When you set a method as 'abstract',it means:"Method don't have any body and you want to implement it at another time in a child class", 
	 but the constructor is called implicitly when the new keyword is used so it can't lack a body.
	 
	 When you set a method as 'static', it means: "Method belong to class, not a particular object" 
	 but constructor implicitly called to initialize an object, so there is no purpose in having a static constructor.
